<p>Today, we’ll be working through some more complex examples that use Python for data analysis and transformation, and vega-lite as the output engine to save to our Jekyll pages.</p>

<p>We start the notebook with a few data manipulations to end up with a figure that shows the max and min square footage as a function of year aquired:</p>

<h1 id="2-more-complex-data-transforms-and-mappable-data-with-the-corgis-dataset">2. More complex Data Transforms (and mappable data) with the Corgi’s dataset</h1>

<p>We went through the steps to make a world map with responsive dot sizes for the number of corgis born as a function of year:</p>

<vegachart schema-url="/assets/json/corgis_dotchart_world.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>

<p>We note that there are some artifacts, but we can fix this with some interpolation:</p>

<vegachart schema-url="/assets/json/corgis_dotchart_world_smooth.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>

<p>Note that without context, this chart is meaningless – we have to be sure to add in context in words (and/or with other plots) about what this map is showing.</p>

<p>Finally, let’s make a choropleth plot with the corgi data:</p>

<vegachart schema-url="/assets/json/corgis_choro_world.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>
